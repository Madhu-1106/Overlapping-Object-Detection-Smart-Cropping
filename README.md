# Overlapping-Object-Detection-Smart-Cropping
This project detects multiple objects in an image and automatically identifies the primary object, even when objects overlap or partially occlude one another. It uses YOLOv8 Segmentation for object detection and MediaPipe Face Detection for accurate prioritization when faces are present.
